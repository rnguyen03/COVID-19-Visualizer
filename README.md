# Software Design Assignment

Software that parses and visualizes data to address inquiries.

## Description

Upon launching the software, a welcoming screen will be displayed to introduce the authors of the code. Following this, the user will be presented with a menu containing multiple options to choose from. The options provided in the menu are diverse and range from configuring the parameters of the data to generating PDFs of graphs that correspond to an inquiry made by one of the authors.

The software is designed to cater to a variety of user needs by providing a range of features and functionalities. With the ability to customize data parameters, users can tailor their analysis to specific requirements. The graphs generated by the software are visually appealing and provide a clear representation of the data. These graphs are created in response to an inquiry made by one of the authors, ensuring that they are relevant and useful.

# Project Workspace

This repl gives you a place to put your project work.  Plese add your data and script files to this workspace.

Note that you can add files from your computer by dragging them in to the files pane


# Data set locations

You are encouraged to bring in relevant data sets of your own, however these are the ones that we have noted in the project discussion:

* [Confirmed Cases of COVID-19](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/confirmed-positive-cases-of-covid-19-in-ontario) : this is the data set we examined last week

* [Government of Ontario Datasets](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset)
    * This is the Open Government data portal.  There are many datasets available for analysis, on COVID-19 and on other topics.
    * Data here is [licensed under the Open Government License - Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/open-government-licence-ontario) and is available for many uses -- please see the license for details.  The [Open Government initiative was set up in 2016](https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/open-government-key-concepts-and-benefits.pdf).

* [Government of Ontario Datasets tagged with "COVID-19"](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset?keywords_en=COVID-19)
    * These are the subset of the above data tagged with this keyword

* [Statistics Canada Health Profile Data](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/health-sante/82-228/search-recherche/lst/page.cfm?Lang=E&GeoLevel=PR&GEOCODE=35)
    * This data provides demographic and other information about specific Public Health Units within the province
    * Statistics Canada ("StatsCan") has a variety of data tools, including the (Census)[https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/census?MM=1] of which the Public Health Profile data is a part
